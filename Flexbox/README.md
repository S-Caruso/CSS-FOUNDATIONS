## Introduction to Flexbox

There are many ways to move elements around on a web page.

**Flexbox** is a way to **position items into rows or columns**, arrange, size, and place the various elements; it is not just a single CSS property but a **whole toolbox of properties** that you can use to put things where you need them. These items will *flex* based on some rules that you can define.<br>
Some properties belong on the flex container, while some go on the flex items.

A **flex container** is any element that has "display: *flex*" on it.<br>
A **flex item** is any element that lives directly *inside of a flex container*.<br>
Somewhat confusingly, **any element can be both a flex container and a flex item**. Said another way, you can also put "display: flex" on a flex item and then use flexbox to arrange its children.
Creating and nesting multiple flex containers and items is the primary way for building up complex layouts.<br>

**Flexbox** is a very powerful tool.
